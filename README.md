# XAudio3: Unit 2 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Design

Index.html will show the "About Me" page with photo and short personal bio.

Portfolio.html will show portfolio images which will be updated with descriptions of my work as I learn more skills.  Currently portfolio is filled with pictures and titles.  If picture's break or cannot be located, an alternate name should display.

Contact.html will show a contact page where a user can input information to be put on a mailing list. 

All pages should link back to one another.  There should also be a fixed Nav-bar on every page.

The container on each page is not working properly; however each page should have a set format/layout and should display mobile responsiveness using bootstrap.
